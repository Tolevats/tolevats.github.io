        "title": "About Me",
        "subtitle": "From ad campaigns to code: crafting stories, building solutions",
        "paragraph1": "Once, my canvas was compelling ad copy; now, it's the intricate world of web development. My journey is a testament to the power of curiosity, a relentless desire to learn and grow. My professional story began in advertising, where as a copywriter, I learned to captivate audiences and distill complex ideas into clear, engaging messages. Little did I know, this foundation in storytelling was preparing me for a different kind of creation.",
        "paragraph2": "The pivotal shift began with the Google UX Design Professional Certificate. This immersive experience ignited a passion for user-centered design and a desire to build digital experiences that were not only beautiful but also intuitive and impactful. It was here that I started to bridge the gap between creative expression and functional problem-solving.",
        "paragraph3": "The final catalyst was my selection into the Laboratoria Web Development bootcamp. This intensive program wasn't just about learning to code; it was about embracing a new way of thinking, collaborating, and innovating. There, I faced a significant challenge: transitioning from conceptual design to the rigorous logic of backend development. I remember grappling with a particularly complex API integration, feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of new information. Instead of giving up, I broke the problem down into smaller, manageable pieces, spending extra hours in front of the screen, collaborating with peers, and tirelessly debugging until the solution clicked. This experience solidified my belief in the power of persistence and problem-solving.",
        "paragraph4": "Today, I’m an entry-level developer eager to apply my diverse skill set to create innovative and user-friendly web solutions. I'm driven by a desire to build applications that not only solve real-world problems but also leave a lasting positive impression.",
